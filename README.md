# TSTUFF

## Proposal

- What problem does your app solve?

  Provides a service for people that need tech stuff for a only a short period of time and enables them to rent products rather than purchasing them.

- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

  Provides a site for users trying to advertise their tech rental and a means for users to actually get into contact and rent those products.

- What is the mission statement?

  The only place to rent your tech.

## Features

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?
  - Users can log in and create a profile.
  - They can then set up items they have for rent such as cameras, TVs, Party equipment like speakers/fog machines etc.
  - Users will be able to Create, Read, Update and Delete rental data.
  - A 2nd user can log in and see items that users have for rent and ask to rent an item. No payment processing necessary for MVP.
  
- What features may you wish to put in a future release?
  - The ability to review previous transactions / renters.
  - Add a payment option into the application allowing people to pay over paypal/stripe etc. to rent their items, schedule a time and place for pick up etc.
  - Add a review system into the app so that the social aspect is there to ensure that users are legit.

- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
  - AirBnb:
    - Let’s homeowners rent out their living spaces for a price
    - Let’s tourists find living spaces to stay (and get a more unique experience)
    - Allows users to register and login to view their booking information
    
  - LetGo:  
    - Let’s users search through a feed of user made posts 
    - Let’s users cut out the middle man and enables them to make an immediate transaction.
    
  - Thumbtack:
    - Let’s users search for services by category and location
		- Provides a clean design and easy-to-use layout

## For Data Scientists


- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1. 
- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

## Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.
  - College students
  - Low income household members
  - Tech enthusiasts
  
- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
	- None yet
  
- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?
	- No

## Research

Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
